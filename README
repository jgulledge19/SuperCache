SuperCache is a plugin for MODX Revolution that will allow you to eliminate text processing of pages
therefore possibly speeding them up significantly.  Note MODX Revolution already uses a cache
system to speed up page load times, this plugin uses the same cache system but in a different way
to deliver even faster page loads if you have moderate to complex templates.
