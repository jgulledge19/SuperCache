SuperCashe is a plugin for MODX Revolution that will allow you to eliminate text processing of pages
therefor possibly speeding them up signifigantly.  Note MODX Revolution already uses a cache
system to speed up pageload times, this plugin uses the same cache system but in a different way
to deleiver even faster page loads if you have moderate to complex templates.  On my test box 
response was 450 to 600 milliseconds and now with supercache it is 60 to 100 milliseconds.  Note 1000 
milliseconds is 1 second.  My test box runs on Windows 2008 RC2, IIS 7.5, PHP 5.3.8 and wincache.
